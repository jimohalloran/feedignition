# FeedIgnition

This repository contains the "FeedIgnition" code from my ["Building a Complete CodeIgniter Application"](https://www.jimohalloran.com/blog/building-a-complete-codeigniter-application/)  blog series.i

THis codebase, like the series on the blog is unfinished and at this stage it's highly unlikely to ever be finished.  However, it's presented as a companion to the blog series in case it has some value to someone.

There's a number of things in this code base that haven't aged well (like using SHA-1 for password hashing), so it shouldn't be considered best practice in 2021.  But it's here "as is" because that's how things were done in 2007.
